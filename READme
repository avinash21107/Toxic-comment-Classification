Overview
This project is a comparative study between traditional LSTM models and a hybrid LSTM + CNN architecture for toxic comment classification.
With the rise of social media platforms (e.g., X, Instagram, Threads), online discussions have become more frequent‚Äîbut also prone to toxic and harmful comments. This project aims to automatically detect and classify toxic comments to support healthier digital communities.

üöÄ Features

Implements Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequence modeling.

Explores a hybrid model (LSTM + CNN) to capture both long-term dependencies and local patterns.

Uses Word2Vec embeddings for transfer learning.

Includes advanced text preprocessing techniques:

Normalization

Lemmatization

Stopword removal

Tokenization

Evaluates models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC score.

 Dtaset

The project uses the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification dataset from Wikipedia discussions.
It contains six toxicity categories:

Toxic

Severe Toxic

Obscene

Threat

Insult

Identity Hate

Class Distribution (Training Set):

Class	Frequency
Toxic	15,154
Severe Toxic	1,482
Obscene	8,399
Threat	425
Insult	7,657
Identity Hate	1,405
Normal	150,346
‚öôÔ∏è Preprocessing

Text Normalization ‚Äì lowercasing, removing punctuation & extra spaces.

Lemmatization ‚Äì converting words to base forms (e.g., ‚Äúrunning‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúrun‚Äù).

Stopword Removal ‚Äì removing common words with little meaning.

Tokenization ‚Äì converting text into sequences of integers for deep learning.

 Models Implemented

LSTM Model: Handles long-term dependencies in text.

CNN Model: Captures local features and n-grams.

Hybrid LSTM + CNN: Combines sequence learning and local pattern detection for improved performance.

Results
Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1 Score	AUC
LSTM + CNN	95.12%	94.25%	95.89%	96.89%	94.60%
LSTM	94.36%	92.37%	93.01%	92.49%	92.96%
CNN	92.48%	89.50%	90.22%	91.87%	89.41%
